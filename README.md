# Vue 3 + Ant Design + Storybook + Vite + Pinia Boilerplate

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite, Ant Design, Storybook, Vite, Pinia. You can directly start development without spending time on project setup.

The stack of this boilerplate is focused on web app front end, therefore Iâ€™ll keep it simple and mainly focuses on following technologies - Vue 3, Vite, Pinia, Ant Design, Storybook.

# Things to update before start

- update readme file to remove/add project related documenation.
- update `name` key in `package.json` file
- update git remote using `git remote set-url origin new.git.url/here` command
- remove unnecessary files.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Tech Stack

**Client:** [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/), [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vuetify3](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/),  [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/),
 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/install), [Ant Design](https://antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce)

**Code Formatter** [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

### Project Setup

`Clone URL : https://github.com/vue-simform/vue-antdv-storybook-boilerplate.git`

Clone repo using HTTP or SSH method.

To use SSH method, please [Follow this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

To use HTTP method, developer has to pass username in git clone url like this `https://{username}@github.com:trishant-kumar/vuetify3-boilerplate.git`
It will promte for application password that you can generate from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

run `npm i` command

copy `.env.example` to `.env`. update `.env` file variables. make sure in this process you don't rename/delete `.env.example` file.

run `npm run dev` command to start development server.

### Other useful scripts

- `npm run build` to build a project
- `npm run preview` to run build preview
- `npm run lint` to check linting issues
- `npm run lint:fix` to fix linting issues
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook (To run storybook you need a node verion 16 or higher)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
